 BLU_ideas_bonus: "Blue Horde Tradition"
 BLU_ideas_start: "Blue Horde Ambitions"
 BLU_the_scourge_of_god: "The Scourge of God"
 BLU_the_scourge_of_god_desc: "The thundering gallop of our horde, the blazing engines of our mangonels, and the alien sound of our language are our greatest weapons and have subdued dozens of European armies in the last century. Our horde is not merely an invasion but a divine punishment; retribution for sin and hubris. Just as Attila razed the cities of the decadent Romans, so have we been destined to punish the excesses of the weak men of the far West. But most importantly: our subjects know this and fear this. They fear the scourge of God."
 BLU_steppification: "Steppification"
 BLU_steppification_desc: "Though we may have defeated the great armies of Europe and claimed their towering cities, if we are to remain, we must establish a power base for our horde. Along with our soldiers, administrators, generals, shamans, and mostly importantly, women and children have accompanied our horde to the far west. We should settle our people across the rich grasslands and plains of Europe and establish our nomadic lifestyle. We shall introduce Mongolian horses, herds, and birds. Our conquest is not just one of arms, nor even one of civilizations, but of the survival of the steppe itself."
 BLU_our_city_of_world's_desire: "Our city of the World's Desire"
 BLU_our_city_of_world's_desire_desc: "Envious eyes have long lusted for the Roman's prized possession: the Queen of Cities. Even our great Khan, Ogdei, was charmed by its splendor, one he had not even imagined he would see in the East. Ironic as it is, it was our foreign armies that conquered “Konstantinoupolis” and now rule over her chambers and halls. Let them gaze, let them envy, let them never forget it was the Blue Horde that took The City of World's Desire."
 BLU_the_yoke's_grand_summon: "The Yoke's Grand Summon"
 BLU_the_yoke's_grand_summon_desc: "As our tributary system begins to wane in many distant and estranged European realms, we must prioritize our relations with our subjects. Our diplomatic advisors have proposed the hosting of a vast summon: the Yoke’s Grand Summon. Our noble subjects will travel to our court to admire our power, offer their tribute, and swear their continuous allegiance. We must maintain a healthy and venerable image as the caretakers of the Mantle of Rome."
 BLU_school_of_epidemology: "School of Epidemiology"
 BLU_school_of_epidemology_desc: "Many of our most successful sieges have been not through the use of powder or even blockades but through the spreading of filth and disease. We have discovered vast books by Roman sages and “philosophers” on the nature of disease and its spread. Many of our generals and agents believe the ancient Greek and Roman texts on medicine can also help us better design and spark epidemics. Our sieges will be preceded by infiltrators and spies who will allow us to take cities without the spilling of blood."
 BLU_true_blue_blood: "True Blue Blood"
 BLU_true_blue_blood_desc: "Our khans are the sons of Genghis, the great son of Tengri and Ogedei, the great conqueror of the West. No dynasty matches our military prowess and achievement but most importantly, we have been able to pass down our traditions to our sons and daughters. Immersion in Mongol tradition and military training has ensured the House of Ogedei is a house that produces history!"
 BLU_doctrina_interioris: "Doctrina Interioris"
 BLU_doctrina_interioris_desc: "Despite our best efforts to distance ourselves from the effeminate philosophy of the Romans, many of our scribes have become drawn to Roman ideas but have synthesized them with our Mongol views. This enlightenment has led to the political conception of the Doctrina Interioris. The Steppe is the great determinant of history and the decadent West and arrogant East are in an eternal struggle with the Steppe. Though these intellectual circles are too buried in books, this vision of history and of our role in history is one we should celebrate and uphold in our ambition for conquest."
