 fep_iberian_flavor.0.t: "The Matter of Baetica"
 fep_iberian_flavor.0.d: "Ever since the Gothic wars in the north, Baetica has been ripe for the taking. But the question remains: what to do with the Baeticans?"
 fep_iberian_flavor.0.a: "It's hopeless for those barbarians."
 fep_iberian_flavor.0.b: "We'll civilize those Goths yet!"

 fep_iberian_flavor.1.t: "The Bishop of Iria Flavia Makes an Offer"
 fep_iberian_flavor.1.d: "As our soldiers approached the walls of [206.GetName] the local bishop from Iria Flavia approached our convoy by himself, panting and out of breath. He told the general that he had rushed to meet the army in hopes of brokering a deal with us. According to his story, the Lusitanian-appointed Duke of [GAL.GetName] had fled when he heard of our armies approaching, leaving the Bishop as the authority in the area. He said that if we allow him to reach the city before us, he can order the men of [GAL.GetName] to open their gates to us, and can even rally many of the other northern Iberians behind him."
 fep_iberian_flavor.1.a: "Anything for a man of faith, even if he may be a heretic.."
 fep_iberian_flavor.1.b: "Duke [GAL.Heir.GetName] has fled you say? To the stake with you, heretic!"

 fep_iberian_flavor.4.t: "The Jews of Mauritania"
 fep_iberian_flavor.4.d: "The Moroccan Jewry or Maroka'im have been in the region since the times of the ancient Carthaginian ports in the region, and grew quite numerous under the tolerant Mauri Empire. Now the local Rabbi in [344.GetName], Abraham, has requested that the Jews be granted semi-autonomous state in the region to guarantee their continued existence."
 fep_iberian_flavor.4.a: "It's an offer we can't refuse."
 fep_iberian_flavor.4.b: "A state is a tad excessive, but we can reaffirm your traditional freedoms under the Mauri."

 fep_iberian_flavor.6.b: "We can administrate Indica ourselves"
 fep_iberian_flavor.6.c: "We will see how this company will fare..."

 fep_iberian_flavor.7.t: "Maroka'im Flee from Pogrom"
 fep_iberian_flavor.7.d: "Needless to say, the Jewry in Mauretania did not take too kindly to our treatment of them. As a response to our pogrom, renowned Jewish pirate Moses Cohen and his brother Abraham (the very same Rabbi that approached us on this matter in the first place) have organized a mass exodus of the Jews in our lands."
 fep_iberian_flavor.7.a: "Where do they possibly think they will go?"
 moroccan_jews_fleeing_tt: "The §YMaroka'im§! and §YSephardim§! in our lands will flee from our oppressive rule and sail to the West as far as their ships will take them..."

 fep_iberian_flavor.8.t: "Strangers at our Shores"
 fep_iberian_flavor.8.d: "Strange ships have been sighted on our shores. Although they do not speak our language, they seem to have come from a long ways away. Anytime we try to ask who they are, they repeat the same two phrases: 'Epalhuam' and 'Etzlaol.'"

 fep_iberian_flavor.8.b: "Accept these newcomers with open arms!"
