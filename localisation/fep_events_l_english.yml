 flavor_blu.0.t: "The Yoke Enters a New Millenium"
 flavor_blu.0.d: "Exactly sixty years have passed since Ogedei first made his base in [261.GetName] in preparation for an invasion of Europe. Little did he know, he would achieve what the rivals of Rome could not: a successful siege and conquest of the City of the World's Desire. Ever since then, we have done our best to honor his legacy by making Europe our new home.\n\n The elderly Khan Kaidu sits on Constantinople's throne, acting as the lynchpin of a tentative Mongol-Rhoman union (being the firstborn son of the previous Khan and educated by the Despoina of Adrianopolis). Unfortunately, all is not exactly well in the realm. While Kaidu's name is feared from Laodicea to Lutetia, the tributaries in the Far West have become uppity as they slowly recover (despite our best efforts...). In the event of the [Root.Monarch.GetTitle]'s unfortunate death, we may be faced with the wrath of Europe once more..."
 flavor_blu.0.a: "Best make use of this prosperity while it lasts."
 flavor_blu.0.a.tt: "As long as [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] lives, as the ruler of the @BLU Blue Horde he will greatly reduce the liberty desire of the all vassal countries."
 flavor_blu.1.t: "The Death of Kaidu Khan"
 flavor_blu.1.d: "Kaidu is dead. As the last Khan to have truly seen the terror the Mongols brought to Europe firsthand, he leaves big shoes for [Root.Monarch.GetName] to fill. Without the wise hand of [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] father at [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] side, [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] will be left on [Root.Monarch.GetHerHis] own against the now-emboldened mobs of angry Europeans looking to give the Blue Horde a taste of their own medicine."
 flavor_blu.1.a: "May the Pax Mongolica ever thrive!"
 flavor_blu.1.a.tt: "Get ready for war, because the farthest tributaries may start to rebel, and they may have help!"
 flavor_blu.2.t: "Death of Kaidu Khan"
 flavor_blu.2.d: "Kaidu is dead. Finally, the great leader of the dastardly Blue Horde is gone, leaving us the chance of a lifetime."
 flavor_blu.2.a: "This is our chance to finally shake the yoke off our necks!"
 flavor_blu.2.b: "Interesting Development..."
 flavor_blu.3.t: "[From.GetName] Declares Their Independence!"
 flavor_blu.3.d: "In the wake of Kaidu's death, the treacherous [From.Monarch.GetTitle] of [From.GetName] has declared [From.Monarch.GetHerHis] realm's autonomy from the Khan of the West!"
 flavor_blu.3.a: "So it's treason, then."
 flavor_blu.3.b: "Damnation! But we have bigger problems.."
 flavor_blu.4.t: "A Chance at Freedom"
 flavor_blu.4.d: "Without the power of Kaidu behind the Mongol throne, we have a real opportunity to gain our autonomy. "
 flavor_blu.4.a: "This is our chance to finally shake the yoke off our necks!"
 flavor_blu.4.b: "I don't feel confident in our ability to take on the Mongols..."
 flavor_blu.5.t: "The Dissolution of the Blue Horde"
 flavor_blu.5.d: "In spite of our best efforts, the Blue Horde is neither as strong nor as unified as it has been. Various relatives and generals of the Khan have arisen, seeking to carve out realms of their own in a vain attempt at mimicking Ogedei's great legacy. Whether the Mongols will remain a power in eastern Europe has yet to be seen, but this moment will surely prove a turning point in history."
 flavor_blu.5.a: "We stray further from righteousness every day..."
 flavor_blu.5.a.tt: "Ogedei's Empire will split into @RML Romylia, @MQD Maqedonia, @ILY Lirya, @PMN Pammongrii, and @DKA Dakya."
 flavor_blu.6.t: "The Future of the Blue Horde"
 flavor_blu.6.d: "It has been a long, tiresome journey. But at last, the Horde has beaten off all challengers and maintained the yoke. As [Root.Monarch.GetName] [Root.Monarch.GetTitle] sits on his throne, his courtiers come to him regarding the new direction of the realm. Will he fully embrace the dream of Rome? Or shall he stay true to the legacy of Genghis Khan above all?"
 flavor_blu.6.a: "Restore the oikoumene! We are Rome reborn!"
 flavor_blu.6.b: "From Qaraqorum to [151.GetName], the Ulus shall stretch once more!"
