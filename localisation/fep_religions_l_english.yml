 #Sangrist
 sangrist: "Sangrist"
 sangrist_religion_desc: "Birthed from the enlightened mind of the Gaílizan king, who after drinking a bad batch of Albariño wine, fell unconscious, and upon awakening claimed to have divine revelation. This new revelation would mix with the verious Christian sects of Iberia and most notably Hermeticism, and birthed Sangrism. The Sangrist faithful believe that to partake in the drinking of wine is to drink the literal blood of God, and that his spirit blessed all grapes at the last supper. Practicioners engage in the sacramental consumption of wine under the belief that intoxication from sacred wine thins the veil betwen the physical and the pleroma, leading to anamnesis or awakening (like the king did). They also believe that the production of wine is a devine act, and so the countryside is dotted with monastic vineyards."

 #Diimauri
 mauri_pagan: "Diimauri"
 mauri_pagan_religion_desc: "The reformed form of the traditional religion of the berber people, found on either side of the sahara. The word 'Diimauri' (of the Mauri) originally referred to the various unorganised cults of the berber people, ranging from the veneration of the sun and the dead, to the gods of the Egyptians and Cartheginians. This would all change with the birth of Iulamet in 710 AD. Iulamet was born in the desert oasis town of Abelassa in the Haggar mountains. She was the daughter of a local chieftain and was married of to a neighbouring tribe. However during the journey to the wedding, her caravan was attacked by Bandal raiders. It is unknown how Iulamet escaped and survived the journey home, but once she did, it was clear she was a changed woman. She claimed that while lost in the desert, during the night, that a radiant figure of light apeared before her. The figure claimed to be the Itni (Dyad), comprised of Satinwur and Wbist, the emination of the true god Anud (Monad). The Itni taught her that in the beginning there existed only the Anud, the almighty God. Although transcendent, it is ultimately ignorant, and from this ignorance it created the Itni by mistake. The Itni, alone in the void, created the immaterial world of light. Feeling lonely, the Itni would create the first man, Assan (Adam), to serve as a companion, and Assan would fill this role for a time.\n\nHowever, as Assan was an emination of the Itni (which although perfect, could not recreate perfection) and not the Anud (who even by mistake creates perfection) he yearned to become as perfect as the Anud. He tried to breach the barrier between himself and the unknowable Anud, and in doing so, shattered himself. From the remains of his body came about the material world, and from the remnants of his mind came humanity. Because of this fall, humanity is now trapped in the material world, doomed to forever reincarnate and suffer in the imperfect material world, the shards of Assan unable to reform him. However, the Itni told her that there was a path to redemption, that should a person live a virtuous life, again and again, that enough shards would be collected to allow their soul to escape the material world and reenter into the world of light. The Itni would comand her to spread her message amongst the people and taught her all the necessary rituals. She would spend the rest of her life preaching and spreading her message, establishing the first order of Marabouts. The faith would mostly be isolated to the haggar mountains, although it would find some success amongst the Tuareg people of the Segu empire. The greatest boon for the faith would be birthed out of a tragedy. With the expulsion of the Tuareg after a failed revoult they would bring their religion with them north to Africa, where they would establish the Mauri Empire. Although short lived, it allowed the phophetesses teachings to be codified in the 'Epiphany of Iulamet' and the organisation of Marabouts to be ratified."
