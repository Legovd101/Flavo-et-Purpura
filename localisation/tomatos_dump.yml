 tomato_dump.1.d:0 "In 1989, in honour of for the passing of the relatively progressive CCP politican Hu Yaobang, a wave of protests, demonstrations and hunger strikes broke out all over China. Thousands of young and hopeful students gather and cry for freedom and democracy in a scale never seen before in East Asia.\nIn 4th June, The Chinese Communist government fearing that they would lose power, sent in the army to massacure the protestors and crushed the movement. To this day they still denied anything ever happened that day and justice were served for the tens of thousands who's hopes and dreams were crushed beneath gunfire and tank tracks.\nMay their sacrifice be forever remembered and justice be served."
